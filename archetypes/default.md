## *gear / method*:
nikon d3400 DSLR & tripod with:
  - 1.8 35mm (fast prime, my baby!)
  - 3.5/5.6 16-85mm (general purpose zoom, doubles as barbell because it weighs more than the 35mm and d3400 combined), used with polarizing filter for high contrast landscapes
  - 4/5.6 70-300mm (also heavy; I only used this once. not sure why I brought it)
